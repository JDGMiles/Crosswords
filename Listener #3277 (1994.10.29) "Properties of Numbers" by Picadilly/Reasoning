[1] is 729, the only three digit number that is both square AND cube. (In other words, it is the only three digit 6th power.)

[12] must begin with "1", as it is a 4-digit number that is the sum of two 3-digit numbers.

[8] and [27] are perfect cubes so their first digits must be in {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}, second digits in {1, 2, 4}, and third digits in {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}.

[2] is prime. We already have 21x, and the only prime beginning 21x is 211.

Prime numbers with more than one digit cannot end in {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8} so we may eliminate these from the final digits of [3], [5], [7], [11], [13], [17], [19], [23], [29], [31], [37], [41], [43], and [47].

[7] is a factor of [21], both three digits, so [7] must begin {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The same elimination applies for [8] factor of [48], and [11] factor of [44].

[8] must end {3, 5, 6} as there are only three 3-digit cubes it could now be.

[22] must end {2, 6, 4, 8} because of the way [11] ends.

We can eliminate {1, 2, 3} from the start of [33], and {8} from the start of [31].

We can eliminate 9 from the end of [11].

Neither [24] nor [25] can begin with a 9, and [49] cannot begin with a 1.

Similarly for [18], [23], and [41].

Similarly for [6], [26], and [32].

Similarly for [9], [18], and [27].

So [42] cannot begin with 1.

[9] cannot start with 4 (because [36] = [9] + [9] + [9] + [9]).

And also therefore [36] cannot start with anything lower than 4.

So [8] must be 125 or 216.

[22] cannot start with 1.

The second digit of [12] must be less than 3.

[15] must start with 1.

[5] must start with 4 or 5.

The second digit of [22] must be 2 or 3.

[9] must be 196 or 225, but if it were 225 then [36] would be 900 and a number would begin with 0.

Therefore [9] is 196 and [36] is 784.

[8] is 216.

[7] must begin with 1.

So [28] must begin {4, 5, 6, 7}.

[28] must end {4, 6, 8}.

[7] cannot end 3.

[18] cannot begin with 1 or 7. It begins with 3.

[27] begins with 5.

[11] is 113 or 313.

[22] is either 226 or 626.

[33] must start with 8.

The second digit of [31] cannot be 9.

[33] must end {2, 4, 8}.

[31] cannot end 9.

The second digit of [12] must be less than 2.

The last digit of [3] cannot be 3.

The last digit of [7] is 7.

The middle digit of [7] must be {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}.

[27] is 512.

[18] is 316.

[4], [16], [25], and [49] must end {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}

[16] and [25] must start with 7 or less.

[28] cannot begin with 4.

[21] cannot begin with 1.

The second digit of [5] cannot be 1, 5, or 8.

[26] cannot begin with 8.

[32] cannot end {3, 4, 5}.

[7] is 127, 137, 157, 167, or 197.

Therefore [28] is 508, 548, 628, 668, or 788.

[3] must be 907, 911, or 919.

[12] must be 1103, 1107, or 1115.

[3] must be 911 or 919.

[12] must be 1107 or 1115.

[45] is 392, 588, 784, or 980.

[45] is 392.
